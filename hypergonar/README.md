# hypergonar

hypergonar is a [Sky-runtime](https://omega.gg/Sky-runtime) frame compositor that acts as a virtual
camera for graphical generative software. It aims at efficiently producing rich and high quality
frame compositions. It's project based, written in plain [QML](https://github.com/qtproject/qtdeclarative)
and allows fast iterations with integrated bash scripting. It's a middle ground between the command
line and traditional editing software with a focus on scene composition and cinematic output.
